Assignment: HW1

Purpose
    The purpose of this program is the declaration and implementation of the
    CharArrayList class. The CharArrayList class represents a dynamically
    allocated array list of char variables. With the member functions I have
    added, one can perform many different alterations to the CharArrayList,
    such as additions, concatenations, subtractions and more. The CharArrayList
    class is now ready for use by anyone in their own sepparate programs.

Acknowledgements
    Besides looking at the posts on Piazza, I did not seek other outside help 
    for this homework assignment.

Files Provided
    CharArrayList.h
        This is the class declaration for the CharArrayList class which includes
        all the member functions and variables, but not the implementation.
    CharArrayList.cpp
        This is the class implementation for the CharArrayList class which
        includes the implementation of all the member functions in the 
        CharArrayList class.
    unit_tests.h
        This file includes all the unit testing functions I used to test the
        implementation of the CharArrayList class.

How to Compile and Run
    This assignment does not include a written main function to use the 
    CharArrayList class. You can compile and run these programs by using the
    unit testing framework provided. To do this, simply type "unit_test" into
    the command line and the program will compile and run using the Makefile.

Data Structure Used
    The data structures used in this program are arrays, more specifically
    dynamically allocated char variable arrays. A major advantage of arrays
    are that you can easily access any of the elements in an array using their
    array index. Another advantage to arrays is that space on the heap for them
    can be declared in one statement, no matter the size of the array. A major
    disadvantage to arrays are that they have fixed lengths, meaning if you need
    to add an element to an array that is already at capacity, you have to 
    create a new, larger array and copy the other array into it. Another 
    disadvantage to arrays is that it is difficult to add or subtract an
    element to an array if it is not the last element in the array. If you
    want to do this, you must then shift all the elements behind this alteration
    over to ensure their are no holes in the array.

Testing Details and Explanation
    In order to test my class implementation, I made use of the unit testing
    framework provided to us. This meant that every time I implemented a new
    CharArrayList member function, I would write multiple corresponding
    unit testing functions that would test the member function. I wrote
    testing functions that would test each member function in a variety of
    different scenarios involving possible edge cases. I would then run the
    unit testing code and see which tests passed and failed, then make the
    neccessary changes.
